            <h2>Bias or Bust activity</h2>
            <p>Ariana Guerra / July 25, 2022</p>
            <p>
              In the bias or bust activity we got two different scenarios from Jeanne and there were two teams. Each team had to prove on a point. 
              For example, in the first-round team 1 had to prove to “eight-year-old” Jeanne that the earth is flat, and team 2 had to prove to 
              Jeanne that the earth is not flat. Team 1 showed that the earth is like a pizza, which was a good idea because “eight-year-old” Jeanne
              loves pizza, which helped lead her to believing that the earth is flat. In round two, team 1 had to prove college student Jeanne that 
              it is better to move to Australia than to stay in America with her boyfriend. Team one, which is the team I was a part of, proved that 
              living in America means having many bills to pay. To live in America it is better if you have a high amount of money, and living in Australia 
              money is not a huge problem. Playing this game was fun because it made us prove that an idea is correct even if we do not believe it's 
              correct. For instance, I personally do not believe that the earth is flat, but even though I did not believe in it I still had to prove 
              that it is flat, which was an interesting experience.

            <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>Ariana Guerra / July 22,2022</p>
            <p>
             Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, critical systems, sensitive information, and data from unauthorized access, 
             criminal use, and digital attacks. Cybersecurity is very important because today there are many cybercriminals that target people’s
             PII <stong>(personally identifiable information)</strong> and then sell that information in underground digital marketplaces, and cybersecurity can help 
             prevent any cybercriminal from collecting any information. Phishing is a cybercrime that happens a lot today. Phishing is when a target 
             is contacted by email, telephone, or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing 
             sensitive information such as PII, banking, and credit card details, and passwords. It is important to know about phishing because 
             many of us receive emails, phone calls, and text messages, and it is important for us to be aware of these kinds of criminals just
             too keep our personal information safe. I did not know what cybersecurity was until now. Learning about cybersecurity was very interesting. 
             I enjoyed it a lot.

            <h2>Citizen Science</h2>
            <p>Ariana Guerra / July 21, 2022</p>
            <p>
              My group’s Citizen Science was called Cardinal Finder. Our goal was to see if weather affects the population of cardinals in 
              the United States. Our idea for us to possibly reach that goal was to have participants from all states to take photos of cardinals
              and send it to us along with the specific weather of that day. Then we would compare the number of cardinals in warmer weather states 
              like Florida, Arizona, and California, to the number of cardinals in colder states like Alaska, Minnesota, and Montana.

            <h2>My Favorite HTML Tutorial</h2>
            <p>Ariana Guerra / July 21, 2022</p>

            <p>
              The video below is a tutorial on how to insert images using HTML. I like this video because it's understandable and the codes are
              seen clearly in the video. Enjoy!

            <h2>Scavenger Hunt</h2>
            <p>Ariana Guerra / July 20th, 2022</p>
            <p>
              Today we went on scavenger hunt where we had to interview important people on campus. We asked them how they used data and technology in 
              their daily job. We also added some other questions to learn more about that person. For example, we interviewed David the dean of 
              libraries and of the ischool and we learned that his way of using data is to try and understand things he needs to make decisions about, 
              and most of the time he uses technology to communicate. Something we learned about David was that in college he majored in English and
              history. This scavenger hunt was a fun activity because we learned new things about the amazing people that work here in 
              Syracuse University.

            <h2>Teachable Machine </h2>
            <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/K6SENlIG-/">Teachable Machine</a>
            <p>Ariana Guerra / July 19, 2022</p>
            <p>
                Me and my partner, Alexis built a teachable machine that was able to identify the colors blue and purple. Me and Alexis tested our
                teachable machine by attaching a full blue image and seeing if our machine was able to identify that the color was blue. When 
                testing the blue image, our machine did identify the right color, so that was great. The first time we tested with a purple 
                image the results were correct, but the second time we tested with another purple image the results were incorrect, which was 
                surprising. Based on what me and my partner built I see artificial intelligence being used as a color identifier.
                For example, let’s say that one day every student should wear a specific color like orange, to school, our machine would be 
                able to identify orange on the students and that could help record the number of students that wore orange to school.

            <h2>Information about Elizabeth Smith Friedman</h2> 
            <p>Ariana Guerra / July 19, 2022</p>
            <p>
                Elizabeth Smith Friedman was a woman who worked in American cryptology. She was the first American female cryptanalyst. 
                In 1923, Mrs. Friedman was a cryptanalyst for the U.S. Navy which led her to have a position with the U.S. Treasury 
                Departments Bureau of Prohibition and Bureau of Customs. After World War Two Mrs. Friedman became a consultant to the 
                International Monetary Fund. She also created communications security systems for the International Monetary Fund.
                Mrs. Friedman began working at riverbank Laboratories in Geneva, Illinois, in 1916. Riverbank Laboratories was one of the first
                facilities in the U.S. to study cryptography. Cryptography played a huge role in Mrs. Friedman’s life.
