            <h2>Scavenger Hunt</h2>

              Today we went on scavenger hunt where we had to interview important people on campus. We asked them how they used data and technology in 
              their daily job. We also added some other questions to learn more about that person. For example, we interviewed David the dean of 
              libraries and of the ischool and we learned that his way of using data is to try and understand things he needs to make decisions about, 
              and most of the time he uses technology to communicate. Something we learned about David was that in college he majored in English and
              history. This scavenger hunt was a fun activity because we learned new things about the amazing people that work here in 
              Syracuse University.

            <h2>Teachable Machine </h2>

                Me and my partner, Alexis built a teachable machine that was able to identify the colors blue and purple. Me and Alexis tested our
                teachable machine by attaching a full blue image and seeing if our machine was able to identify that the color was blue. When 
                testing the blue image, our machine did identify the right color, so that was great. The first time we tested with a purple 
                image the results were correct, but the second time we tested with another purple image the results were incorrect, which was 
                surprising. Based on what me and my partner built I see artificial intelligence being used as a color identifier.
                For example, let’s say that one day every student should wear a specific color like orange, to school, our machine would be 
                able to identify orange on the students and that could help record the number of students that wore orange to school.

                Elizabeth Smith Friedman was a woman who worked in American cryptology. She was the first American female cryptanalyst. 
                In 1923, Mrs. Friedman was a cryptanalyst for the U.S. Navy which led her to have a position with the U.S. Treasury 
                Departments Bureau of Prohibition and Bureau of Customs. After World War Two Mrs. Friedman became a consultant to the 
                International Monetary Fund. She also created communications security systems for the International Monetary Fund.
                Mrs. Friedman began working at riverbank Laboratories in Geneva, Illinois, in 1916. Riverbank Laboratories was one of the first
                facilities in the U.S. to study cryptography. Cryptography played a huge role in Mrs. Friedman’s life.
