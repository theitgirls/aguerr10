            Hi my name is Ariana, I am going to be a junior in high school. Iâ€™m from Queens, New York. I decided to take this class because I find technology very interesting. I want to see what great things we do on computers, because I know there are many things we can do on computers. I enjoy family time. I like to watch horror movies. I love to sing and act. And I also enjoy reading.
